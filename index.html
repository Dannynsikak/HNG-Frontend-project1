          <h2>Goal 1: Learn a New Programming Language</h2>
          <p>
            I want to learn <strong>PHP</strong> in the next 6 months. Because
            <strong>PHP</strong> works well with
            <strong>HTML</strong>,<strong>CSS</strong>, and
            <strong>Javascript</strong> making it easier for frontend developers
            to incorporate dynamic content and server-side logic into their
            projects.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also <strong>PHP</strong> is known for its relatively
            straightforward syntax and ease of learning for beginners. This
            makes it an excellent starting point for understanding backend
            development
          </p>
          <p>
            Another good fact i like about <strong>PHP</strong> is that it
            allows you to build real-world applications like e-commerce
            websites,blogs,social networks, and more. This practical experience
            can be very rewarding and useful.

          <h2>Goal 2: Contribute to Open Source</h2>
          <p>
            I am to contribute to an open-source project in the next year, for
            <strong>example,</strong> <strong>PHP</strong> is open-source and
            free to use. it runs on almost any server, including Apache and
            Nginx, which are also open-source. This makes it a cost-effective
            option for web development.
